guide workthrough  and then some.


Should I become an author?

Will i see daylight before the dawn?

Or a poet?

Woe, Woe is me.
The stars twinkle in the sky as the dog moon shines through the cloud. 
Jupiter and Venus glow steadily light in the night chill.


Sometimes Mars glows red in the sky, passing though Orion and ever onwards.

Saturn is sometimes visible if you know where to look.

Neptune and Uranus are not seen without aid

Pluto was once a planet.
No longer its true.

But more interesting things beyond may lie.


Beware! beware! beware!
